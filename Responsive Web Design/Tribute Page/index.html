          <br />
          <li><strong>1996</strong> - At the age of ten his father bought him a computer and since then throughout his childhood he immersed himself into study of computer, internet and internet culture.He attended North Shore Country Day School, a small private school near Chicago, until 9th grade.[21] Swartz left high school in the 10th grade, and enrolled in courses at a Chicago area college.</li>
          <br />
          <li><strong>1999</strong> - At the age of thirteen, he created a website called <b>Theinfo.org</b>. Theinfo.org made Swartz the winner of the ArsDigita Prize, given to young people who create "useful, educational, and collaborative" noncommercial websites.</li>
          <br />
          <li><strong>2000</strong> - He became a member of the working group that authored the RSS 1.0 web syndication specification. Swartz attended Stanford University, but dropped out after his first year</li>
          <br />
          <li><strong>2005</strong> - During Swartz's first year at Stanford, he applied to Y Combinator's very first Summer Founders Program, proposing to work on a startup called Infogami. After working on Infogami with co-founder Simon Carstensen over the summer of 2005, Aaron opted not to return to Stanford, choosing instead to continue to develop and seek funding for Infogami..</li>
          <br />
          <li><strong>2006</strong> - In early fall of 2006, Swartz worked with his fellow co-founders of another nascent Y-Combinator firm Reddit, to rewrite Reddit's Lisp codebase using Python and web.py. When Infogami failed to find further funding, Y-Combinator organizers suggested that Infogami merge with Reddit, Swartz was given the title of co-founder of Reddit.</li>
          <br />
          <li><strong>2007</strong> - In September 2007, Swartz joined with Infogami co-founder Simon Carstensen to launch a new firm, Jottit, in another attempt to create another markdown driven content management system in Python.</li>
          <br />

            <strong>2008</strong> - In 2008, Swartz founded Watchdog.net, "the good government site with teeth," to aggregate and visualize data about politicians. In the same year, he wrote a widely circulated Guerilla Open Access Manifesto.<br /><br />Swartz downloaded about 2.7 million federal court documents stored in the PACER (Public Access to Court Electronic Records) database managed by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.<br /><br />The Huffington Post characterized
            his actions this way: "Swartz downloaded public court documents from the PACER system in an effort to make them available outside of the expensive service. The move drew the attention of the FBI, which ultimately decided not to press charges as the documents were, in fact, public."
          </li>
          <br />
          <li><strong>2009</strong> - In 2009, wanting to learn about effective activism, Swartz helped launch the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. He wrote on his blog, "I spend my days experimenting with new ways to get progressive policies enacted and progressive politicians elected."</li>

            <strong>2010</strong> - In 2010, Swartz co-founded Demand Progress, a political advocacy group that organizes people online to "take action by contacting Congress and other leaders, funding pressure tactics, and spreading the word" about civil liberties, government reform, and other issues.<br /><br />During academic year 2010–11, Swartz conducted research studies on political corruption as a Lab Fellow in Harvard University's Edmond J.

At the time, Swartz was a research fellow at Harvard University, which provided him with a JSTOR account.<br /><br />
            On the night of January 6, 2011, Swartz was arrested near the Harvard campus by MIT police and a United States Secret Service agent. He was arraigned in Cambridge District Court on two state charges of breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony.On July 11, 2011, Swartz was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of wire fraud, computer fraud, unlawfully obtaining information from a protected computer, and recklessly damaging a protected computer.<br /><br />On September
            12, 2012, federal prosecutors filed a superseding indictment adding nine more felony counts, which increased Swartz's maximum criminal exposure to 50 years of imprisonment and $1 million in fines.

          <br />
          <li><strong>2013</strong> - On the evening of January 11, 2013, Swartz's girlfriend, Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman, found him dead in his Brooklyn apartment. A spokeswoman for New York's Medical Examiner reported that he had hanged himself. No suicide note was found.</li>

            >"He used his prodigious skills as a programmer and technologist not to enrich himself but to make the Internet and the world a fairer, better place. Aaron had an unbeatable combination of political insight, technical skill, and intelligence about people and issues. I think he could have revolutionized American (and worldwide) politics. His legacy may still yet do so."<br /><br />
